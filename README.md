# Onchain Coordination Dashboards

A tactical library of dashboards, loop-based metrics, and real-time coordination patterns designed for DAOs and networked orgs. This repo reflects the BDV thesis that feedback loops — not static KPIs — are the sovereign path to operational clarity.

## 🧭 Purpose

- Measure what matters: contributor health, coordination velocity, and loop strength
- Visualize North Star metrics that evolve with the org
- Replace snapshots with living dashboards for action

## 📂 Structure

- `/NorthStar/` – Define your sovereign metric architecture
- `/Feedback-Loops/` – JSON schemas or charts of real-time loops (e.g., contributor reviews, proposal flow)
- `/DAO-Health/` – Frameworks for scorecards and pulse checks

## 🧠 Inspiration

Built on principles of:
- OODA loops (Observe–Orient–Decide–Act)
- Cyclical governance
- Sovereign coordination
